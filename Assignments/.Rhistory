# This plot is a little more informative in that more it shows a potential relationship between proximity to commercial centers, prices, and NOx. Higher NOx values are associated with proximity to commerce, indicating that perhaps local traffic (as opposed to interstate traffic) is a more significant sources of NOx. Let's see if we can better source the NOx to either local or interstate travel.

I will drop index is subsequent plots.

# This plot is a little clunky but it does show that there are mix of extremely high and low home values near commercial centers and located near high NOx values. High extremes also appear far from commercial centers, but low extremes do not. At this stage, we can't really say much about these data except that NOx appears to be coming from local traffic (near commercial centers) but the relationship between home values, NOx, and proximity to commerce is unclear, if any relationship exists.
